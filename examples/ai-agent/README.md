To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

> **Note:** This example includes `effect` as a dependency, which is required since `@embed-ai/sdk` now uses `effect` as a peer dependency.

Now ensure you're environment variables are set (see .env.example for reference)

To run:

```bash
bun run main.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.2.0. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
