# AI Code Usage Instructions

## General Repository Rules

- **USE BUN!** we always use bun as package manager and runtime for our scripts and commands.
- **Effect** the packages are written with Effect which is a standard library for Typescript. Rely on it to keep your code verbosity minimal and files clean.
    - You can always use the websearch tools to reference `https://effect.website/llms-full.txtx` for the Effect Documentation
- **Straightforward Minimalism** we keep every change as straightforward and simple as possible. Less code is more! Avoid new dependencies whereever you can. Likely we can just get it done or use Effect.
